A: We’re a different company today than we were 10, 5, even 3 years ago.  Our journey has been transformational, from a traditional health benefits organization to a lifetime, trusted health partner. 

We have a diverse portfolio of digital, pharmacy, behavioral, clinical and complex care solutions that are offered through our current services businesses and government business.

It’s through all of our assets that we are able to focus on serving people across the entire care journey, connecting them to the care, support, and resources they need to lead healthy lives. It’s also how we are able to deliver on our strategy, exceed expectations for our consumers, and drive growth for our shareholders. 

Equipped with digital capabilities, data, and resources, we are uniquely able to champion a whole health approach and advance health beyond healthcare for our consumers, their families, and our communities. Elevance Health better reflects our business and the company we are today.

In celebration of Women’s History Month, we would like to spotlight, Ursula Lee, Co-Chair of AZ WIN, AutoZone's Women’s Business Resource Group. Ursula is a seven-year AutoZoner who has grown her career in Commercial credit from Administrator to her current position as Manager.  Ursula believes it is important to bring all the elements of who you are to work and employs this philosophy in leading her team and in participating in philanthropy. She also believes this is critical to networking within an inclusive and diverse workplace and to facilitating her own personal and professional development. 
 
AutoZone places an immense focus on supporting AutoZoners and the Greater Memphis community which closely aligns with her personal mission of being a helper of people.  Ursula is a Board member of the AutoZoner Assistance Fund (AAF), a nonprofit organization established to support fellow AutoZoners who experience short-term emergency funding needs resulting from natural disasters and personal tragedies. Ursula states, she is proudest when she sees AutoZoners whom she has helped develop, grow into successful and supportive leaders who, in turn, help to develop more up-and-coming leaders. “AutoZone’s Values and focus on impacting the community also enable me to connect with my community on a larger scale, helping to create healthier families, neighborhoods, and societies. This is my definition of true success.”   
  
In her free time, Ursula loves playing laser tag with her nieces and nephews and is the current reigning champ!

The challenges many faces in obtaining access to veterinary care for their pets are one of the reasons PetSmart Charities works hard every day to equip their partners with the grants they need to help provide care for local communities.

We're grateful to our PetSmart Charities team members and our PetSmart store associates for their dedication to pets and all who love them.

👋 Meet Kyle: Store Leader at Georgetown PetSmart 
“I seek to support others' mental health by actively listening. As a leader, it is very easy to assign tasks, tell people what needs to be done or give business updates, but we sometimes lose focus on the most important part of any good business and that is the people running it. I always try to stay mindful of how others may be feeling and I have an open-door policy with all of my associates. Getting to know our associates on a little more personal level, learning about their families, favourite activities or past personal experiences allows us to create a warm, welcoming environment within our store.”

Tracey Lee, a Paralegal in Product and Distribution Law & Compliance, has been working from the Minneapolis Corporate Center three days a week.

“Going into the office works for me, because it allows me to separate my home environment from my work environment. It gives me a sense of purpose and a positive attitude, and I’m enjoying our beautiful building.”

After an incredible 29 years here at GAP, Karl Owen (known here as KO) is retiring to start his next big adventure!
 
He’ll be missed by everyone within GAP, but also from a raft of customers that Karl has been involved with during his journey at GAP.
 
From manufacturing roles in the early days of door panels, through to depot management, Karl has excelled in whatever he was involved with.
 
During recent years though, it was Karl’s passion for installation, training and support that shone through, in particular for Rockdoors.
 
Lots of customers and teams members will have left Karl’s training sessions, not only more knowledgeable about installations and products, but they’ll have had a good time doing it too thanks to his personality and approach to learning. A natural trainer!!

Ota is the oldest tofu company in America that makes tofu by hand using traditional Japanese methods.

1. Short-term disability insurance
Covers employees for around three to six months when a temporary covered illness or injury keeps them out of work.

2. Long-term disability insurance
Benefits can extend for years or even until employees reach retirement age, but usually pay out less than short-term policies and can be more costly.

3. Social Security Disability Insurance
Only covers employees who are completely unable to work due to a severe, long-term, total disability, if they have paid Social Security taxes.

4. Workers’ compensation insurance
Only covers workplace-sustained injuries or illnesses, with the company filing a claim on behalf of the employee with whomever processes claims in your state.

Steve Henry (he/him/his) has been on the Albertsons Companies team for nearly 19 years, starting out pushing carts in the snowy New Hampshire weather and currently working as Director, Data Quality and Shelf Communication in our Pleasanton office.

Steve shares: “Pride is about two things for me: joy and being boldly, unapologetically visible. Many LGBTQ+ folks spend a portion or majority of their formative years (and beyond) hiding a piece of themselves from everyone around them and often (not always) that comes with a lot of shame.  Pride is about reclaiming space and rejecting the closet that held a lot of us back and continues to hold back others who can’t come out yet because they’re not ready or it’s not safe to do so.”

What does it mean to Steve to be a member of the LGBTQ+ community? 

""My journey is different than a straight person’s – just like my journey as a cisgendered man is very different from someone in the trans community. I get to see the world a bit differently because of that and I’m honestly super thankful that I do. I think it’s challenged me to be a better ally to other marginalized groups within the LGBTQ community and outside of it. It’s also allowed me to create a really wonderful chosen family in addition to my birth one (who are fantastic, too!).  I would never want to erase any part of me – including the less than great experiences – because I’m pretty proud of the gay man I’ve become and continue to become.""

We're grateful to have Steve on the Albertsons Companies team and as a member of the Albertsons Pride Alliance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Helen Dalton has been part of the Albertsons Companies team for 11 years and currently works as Labor Relations Manager in our Southwest Division. Helen is a proud member of the Southwest Division’s Diversity and Inclusion Council as well as the Albertsons Pride Alliance ARG, and is an active volunteer with the ACI Crisis Response Team.

Helen recognizes the importance of resource groups such as the Pride Alliance and Diversity and Inclusion Council in the workplace. “For far too long, LGBTQ+ individuals had to compartmentalize themselves in order to be accepted in certain social and work environments. No one should ever have to hide or feel shame for who they are or who they love.

I encourage anyone and everyone at Albertsons Companies to join as many ARGs as possible. Share your story and truly listen to the stories of others. Realize your own subconscious biases and strive every day to overcome them. We are all in this together and together we can affect great change.”

We’re thankful to have Helen as a champion of diversity and inclusion at Albertsons Companies and proud to shine the spotlight on an amazing associate today.  #PrideMonth",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With services ranging from research to integrated whole person care delivery, pharmacy, behavioral health to digital platform and technology services, Carelon will build better care for people and enhance efficiencies systemwide. Through partnerships across healthcare, Carelon will improve outcomes and reduce total cost of care through digitally enabled solutions to improve whole person health. The transition of our capabilities and services under the Carelon brand will take place over the next two years. 

The Wellpoint brand will unify our Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial health plans in select markets, simplifying interactions that consumers have with these health plans. The transition will take place over the next few years, and will not impact affiliated Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield and Anthem Blue Cross health plans. 

The launch of these brands will optimize and streamline our brand portfolio, reduce complexities, and further underscore our evolution to deliver solutions beyond traditional health insurance, simplify the healthcare experience, and advance health beyond healthcare.

One happened early in the process, said Project Manager Tyler Jeziorski.

""The water table is roughly 8 feet below grade, so all of the underground utilities, pipe and electrical duct banks were all in that water table. When you have contaminated soil, you can’t simply discharge water off the site.""

""We had to essentially lower the water table locally and rotate it around the project while we installed the underground utilities and poured all the major foundations. To have adequate storage space to support these efforts, the team dug additional temporary retention ponds. It was a huge challenge for the job team to get that work done.""

""Work that Works gives me an unmatched level of flexibility; I have the freedom to plan my day and I feel a great sense of ownership and autonomy. I prioritize my office days for when in-person collaboration is essential, or on days where I don’t have back to back meetings, so I can engage and socialize with colleagues at the office. Working from home allows me to do more deep work undistracted and I have more time available to do things that normally would have been postponed to after office hours. Being at the office energizes me and helps me being more creative. To me the magic happens at the coffee machine, during lunch and at that impromptu brainstorming session where you’re leaning over a colleague’s desk to pick their brain on a problem you’ve been stuck with for days. Being able to choose the setting that makes me most productive is something I highly value and appreciate and I can’t imagine working in a different way.""

Bike To Work is a Swiss-wide health promotion campaign organized by the Pro Velo Switzerland association that promotes well-being and sustainable mobility practices. Nearly 150 Jabil employees have collectively participated across Bettlach, Grenchen, Le Locle, Mezzovico, Hägendorf and Balsthal.
 
“Bike To Work has been the right stimulus for me to resume regular physical activity,"" Silvio Bianchi, senior facility project technician, said. ""During the two months of the challenge, I kept a participation rate of 100% by cycling every day to work, thanks to the support and engagement of my team. Moreover, I rediscovered a sport that I am passionate about.

""I would like to take this opportunity to thank Jabil for joining Bike To Work and for focusing so much on the health and well-being of employees.""

Bike to work is just one outdoor activity employees are taking part in. A newly-launched running group unites employees who share a passion for running with the goal of taking part in a local half-marathon in September. 
 
Participation in biking and running groups can increase team spirit, create a more inclusive and positive environment and reduce stress while simultaneously helping the environment. Yet, no matter the activity, our Swiss sites' commitment to this program reminds us that our mental and physical well-being can benefit from a connection to nature and promotes a culture of prioritizing #MentalHealth.

The funds from this year’s campaign will be donated to local food banks benefiting veterans, service members, their families, and local communities. 

“Humana and the VFW created the Uniting to Combat Hunger campaign in 2018 to make sure Veterans and their families across the country get the nutritious foods they need,” said Edward Sandrick, Humana’s Director of the Veterans Channel. “This collaboration is a great example of how Humana and the VFW have been working together for 10 years toward our shared goal of removing barriers to good health for Veterans and their families nationwide. We want to thank all of the VFWs who got involved.”  

Committed to supporting Veterans’ health, Humana also donated $50,000 to two VFW programs that provide financial aid to veterans to help with basic needs such as paying rent and that helps veterans access their earned Veterans Affairs benefits and compensation.

To further their commitment to #DisabilityInclusion, Jabil sites in Clinton and Devens, Massachusetts, partnered with the Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission (MRC), an organization that promotes empowerment and encourages the pursuit of independence and employment for people with disabilities in the community. Clinton and Devens have utilized their partnership to identify candidates and roles for the specific needs of their sites, hire employees with disabilities, and provide the on-site training necessary for those employees to reach their full potential. MRC also provides site leaders and managers with training on how to best support employees and create a successful environment.
   
“Our partnership with MRC has helped us create a more inclusive environment at Jabil Clinton and Devens,” said Jodi W., senior regional human resources manager. “The team at MRC understands our business needs and partners with us in assessing available talent for today and the future.” 

The combination of employment opportunities and education at our sites creates a path to a more equitable workplace for all.

Synovus and other financial institutions have been made aware of a social media scam requesting financial assistance in the form of gift cards. After the gift cards are sent, the individual states the gift cards do not work and will give the customer instructions that lead to the customer calling fraudulent phone numbers. The final goal is for the customer to scan a QR code at a Bitcoin ATM at which point their account is drained. Stay Alert!

DO make sure it’s legit. Scammers see an opportunity to take advantage of your generosity so it’s important to do your homework before making a contribution.

DO trust your gut. Social engineering scams try to cash in on personal hardships and use scare tactics and a sense of urgency to get you to act quickly. 

DO look for reliable alternatives to make donations. It’s a good idea to search organization names on a charity watchdog site, like GuideStar and Charity Navigator.

DO protect your payments. The Federal Trade Commission recommends avoiding cash, gift cards, and money wires as payments, suggesting you stick to credit cards or checks instead.

Highway 417, or Queensway, is a major thoroughfare in the city. A 5-kilometre section was originally scheduled to be closed for 82 hours to allow crews to replace the bridge using the rapid-bridge replacement approach.

During that time, crews needed to demolish the bridge, move the new bridges – which were prefabricated offsite over the course of a year prior – into place, and pave and paint traffic lines. 

Working around the clock through the weekend, the stretch was reopened on August 14, six hours ahead of schedule and before Monday’s morning commute.

The collaboration has raised 3.5 million meals since 2018 to ensure that no more military and veteran families go hungry. The funds from this year’s campaign will be donated to local food banks benefiting veterans, service members, their families, and local communities.

“Humana and the VFW created the Uniting to Combat Hunger campaign in 2018 to make sure Veterans and their families across the country get the nutritious foods they need,” said Edward Sandrick, Humana’s Director of the Veterans Channel. “This collaboration is a great example of how Humana and the VFW have been working together for 10 years toward our shared goal of removing barriers to good health for Veterans and their families nationwide. We want to thank all of the VFWs who got involved.” 

Committed to supporting Veterans’ health, Humana also donated $50,000 to two VFW programs that provide financial aid to veterans to help with basic needs such as paying rent and that helps veterans access their earned Veterans Affairs benefits and compensation.

Q: What did you learn from this project?

And #2, the team did a good job of giving creative solutions a chance. We pursued a continuous flow of prototyping and iterating to gather more insight. I can show you a pile of what appears to be failed prototypes… but I can tell you that each one of them provided insight into customers’ challenges and the solution space.""

The campaign will work to raise one million meals by July 2023.

Campaign details for this year were announced at VFW’s national convention in July where Humana associates, Veterans and members of military families participated in events such as packing pounds of potatoes to help with local flood relief efforts in Kansas City, Missouri.   

The partnership raised over one million meals in 2021 and 2022, which was more than double the goal of 500,000 meals. Since 2018, VFW and Humana have provided over 3.5 million meals to those in need across the country.

“Rosh Hashanah is…one of my favorite holidays,” said Melissa. “I love being in the kitchen with my mom cooking our holiday meals and sharing those meals with our family. One of the traditions we started years back was that in addition to cooking our family favorites, we pick another country and eat the foods they would eat on Rosh Hashanah.”  

“A big misconception is that you celebrate Yom Kippur,” said Melissa. “It’s our day of atonement, where we fast from sundown the night before to sundown the next day. It’s a somber day. It’s the holiest day of the year. It’s not a day of celebration.” 

“I love that I work for a company that values inclusion and diversity,” said Melissa. “Over the past year I have had ‘candid conversations’ with colleagues of different faiths and races to better understand their culture, religions and beliefs while sharing mine.

Oscilloscope history begins in the 19th century when French Physicist Andre Blondel captured the first recorded waveforms on a galvanometer which detected changes in the current that was recorded by manually drawing a diagram of the wave formations.

William Duddell created the photographic oscillograph which used a mirror galvanometer that allowed waveforms to be measured and recorded directly.

In 1897 the cathode-ray tube, invented by Karl Ferdinand Braun, made it possible to record higher frequency measurements and led to the design of the first analog oscilloscope.

In 1946 Howard Vollum and Melvin Murdock developed the first triggered oscilloscope — the Tektronix Model 511. It allowed for more precise measurements as the waveforms were displayed and then repeated to create a stronger graphed image.

Since then, oscilloscope development has grown exponentially. After 76 years, Tektronix is still the lead producer of oscilloscopes. Without innovators like Blondel, Duddell, Braun, Vollum, and Murdock, Tektronix would not be here today. Happy Inventors Day!

If you gain weight, drink things. Drink a lot of water. And always try and put on a pair of shoes and get out and walk at least. Otherwise, you'll just solidify.

Alan Grofe battled cancer six years ago and has been cancer-free for five years. When he chose to get back into road racing after recovering from cancer surgery, he demonstrated one way to be an active ager. “It was so great to come back,” he said. “Running has instilled a zest for life in me. It’s the aerobic activity that carries me forward. I’m 78 years old and here I am still running and racing. I’m having a great time.”

Humana promotes positive ways to lead a full and vibrant life as you get older at neighborhood centers across the country where you can join cooking or yoga classes, attend a book club or simply enjoy a snack and a chat.

They’ll explain they need a ‘chemo cut’ in preparation for losing their hair during treatment,” said Lori Moran Chumley, Director of Salon Operations and Communication. “As a breast cancer survivor myself, I thought about how magical it would be for us to be able to share with those clients that they don’t have to lose their hair – that there’s another option during chemo treatment.”

Pam Stevens, Store Director in our Portland Division, has been on our team since 1988 and was diagnosed with Ductal Carcinoma in 2015.
 
Pam shares: “Hearing I had breast cancer was devastating, but I faced it head on and every day started with a positive attitude. I won't lie, it was the toughest thing I had ever been through.”
 
We’re thrilled to share that Pam has been cancer-free for over six years! She credits family, friends and teammates for showing up for her during diagnosis and treatment and for helping her put herself first.
 
“I had the best support team at Store #0400. I was determined to go through chemo and work as long as I could. I made it to my 3rd round out of 8. My Store Director, Tiffany Knottingham, is the most supportive manager that I could have had. She said, 'Pammy, you need to go and take care of yourself. We will all be waiting for you when you return to work.' I did return, 9 weeks later, and I am still here with a smile on my face.” 
 
Pam encourages those who have a loved one facing a cancer diagnosis to show up – no matter what. “Reach out and offer help or just show up. We all say ‘we are fine’ or ‘we don't need help’ but trust me, we are not. We do need you.”
 
Pam’s number one tip for you? “It can happen to anyone. Please get your mammograms. I was lucky and caught mine early. Don't wait because it may be too late.”
 
Pam, thank you for sharing your story. We are one team and we're glad you're part of our family. We're so happy to celebrate you today!

The Future Women in Kiewit Summit / Women’s Construction & Engineering Leadership Seminar was first held in 2010. Since then, nearly 900 U.S. and Canadian collegiate women majoring in construction and engineering have attended the event to network with Kiewit employees and gather personal perspectives about construction and engineering industry careers. The 2022 summit is next month and will feature a diverse group of Kiewit leaders. 

Our partnership with the Thurgood Marshall College Fund (TMCF) was established in 2022. In February, 20 Historically Black College & University (HBCU) students attended a two-day immersion event at Kiewit University in Omaha, Nebraska. During the event, students engaged with Kiewit employees from across the organization, who shared insights about their career journeys at Kiewit. Eight attendees interned with us this past summer and are receiving scholarship support for the 2022-2023 school year.

Our Women in Kiewit and Legacy Minority Scholarships, launched in 2018 and 2019, respectively, have supported the collegiate careers of 33 students. Recipients, who are dependents of Kiewit employees and majoring in construction or engineering fields, receive $5,000 per semester for four years, as well as internship opportunities with Kiewit.

Angela Fielding, Co-President of the IMPACT Network Resource Group and Director of Provider Experience and Network Transformation/Humana Healthy Horizons, is a 3-year breast cancer survivor.  

Angela shares her story of being diagnosed with breast cancer. She also discusses the importance of access to and utilization of sophisticated digital diagnostic techniques to detect breast cancer in women with dense breasts and women of color. 

“The message that I want to share with women, particularly Black and African American women about my experience, is that early detection is essential to survival,” said Angela. “We must ensure that we are being intentional about getting breast cancer screenings. Early detection was due to vigilance with my examinations and self-advocacy.”

Yesterday we went out to photograph one of the first ever Rockdoors to be installed over 25 years ago – and as you can see it has truly stood the test of time 😍
 
Whilst the door is still in fantastic condition, the homeowner has decided to upgrade to a more contemporary style of Rockdoor.
 
The current door is the old Ayres design with Renaissance glass, which was phased out many years ago, and replaced with the Georgia which features more discreet mouldings.
 
The door may have been installed back in 1997, but it still has that perfect ‘close’ that Rockdoor is synonymous with. 
 
A brand-new Agate Grey Vogue Cube is being installed next week and the homeowner cannot wait for her door to stand out from the crowd! 💜",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
