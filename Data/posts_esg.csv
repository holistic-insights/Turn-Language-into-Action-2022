Helen Dalton has been part of the Albertsons Companies team for 11 years and currently works as Labor Relations Manager in our Southwest Division. Helen is a proud member of the Southwest Division‚Äôs Diversity and Inclusion Council as well as the Albertsons Pride Alliance ARG, and is an active volunteer with the ACI Crisis Response Team.

Helen recognizes the importance of resource groups such as the Pride Alliance and Diversity and Inclusion Council in the workplace. ‚ÄúFor far too long, LGBTQ+ individuals had to compartmentalize themselves in order to be accepted in certain social and work environments. No one should ever have to hide or feel shame for who they are or who they love.

I encourage anyone and everyone at Albertsons Companies to join as many ARGs as possible. Share your story and truly listen to the stories of others. Realize your own subconscious biases and strive every day to overcome them. We are all in this together and together we can affect great change.‚Äù

Steve shares: ‚ÄúPride is about two things for me: joy and being boldly, unapologetically visible. Many LGBTQ+ folks spend a portion or majority of their formative years (and beyond) hiding a piece of themselves from everyone around them and often (not always) that comes with a lot of shame.¬† Pride is about reclaiming space and rejecting the closet that held a lot of us back and continues to hold back others who can‚Äôt come out yet because they‚Äôre not ready or it‚Äôs not safe to do so.‚Äù

What does it mean to Steve to be a member of the LGBTQ+ community?¬†

""My journey is different than a straight person‚Äôs ‚Äì just like my journey as a cisgendered man is very different from someone in the trans community. I get to see the world a bit differently because of that and I‚Äôm honestly super thankful that I do. I think it‚Äôs challenged me to be a better ally to other marginalized groups within the LGBTQ community and outside of it. It‚Äôs also allowed me to create a really wonderful chosen family in addition to my birth one (who are fantastic, too!).¬† I would never want to erase any part of me ‚Äì including the less than great experiences ‚Äì because I‚Äôm pretty proud of the gay man I‚Äôve become and continue to become.""

""Work that Works gives me an unmatched level of flexibility; I have the freedom to plan my day and I feel a great sense of ownership and autonomy. I prioritize my office days for when in-person collaboration is essential, or on days where I don‚Äôt have back to back meetings, so I can engage and socialize with colleagues at the office. Working from home allows me to do more deep work undistracted and I have more time available to do things that normally would have been postponed to after office hours. Being at the office energizes me and helps me being more creative. To me the magic happens at the coffee machine, during lunch and at that impromptu brainstorming session where you‚Äôre leaning over a colleague‚Äôs desk to pick their brain on a problem you‚Äôve been stuck with for days. Being able to choose the setting that makes me most productive is something I highly value and appreciate and I can‚Äôt imagine working in a different way.""

1. Short-term disability insurance
Covers employees for around three to six months when a temporary covered illness or injury keeps them out of work.

2. Long-term disability insurance
Benefits can extend for years or even until employees reach retirement age, but usually pay out less than short-term policies and can be more costly.

3. Social Security Disability Insurance
Only covers employees who are completely unable to work due to a severe, long-term, total disability, if they have paid Social Security taxes.

4. Workers‚Äô compensation insurance
Only covers workplace-sustained injuries or illnesses, with the company filing a claim on behalf of the employee with whomever processes claims in your state.

In celebration of Women‚Äôs History Month, we would like to spotlight, Ursula Lee, Co-Chair of AZ WIN, AutoZone's Women‚Äôs Business Resource Group. Ursula is a seven-year AutoZoner who has grown her career in Commercial credit from Administrator to her current position as Manager.  Ursula believes it is important to bring all the elements of who you are to work and employs this philosophy in leading her team and in participating in philanthropy. She also believes this is critical to networking within an inclusive and diverse workplace and to facilitating her own personal and professional development. 
 
AutoZone places an immense focus on supporting AutoZoners and the Greater Memphis community which closely aligns with her personal mission of being a helper of people.  Ursula is a Board member of the AutoZoner Assistance Fund (AAF), a nonprofit organization established to support fellow AutoZoners who experience short-term emergency funding needs resulting from natural disasters and personal tragedies. Ursula states, she is proudest when she sees AutoZoners whom she has helped develop, grow into successful and supportive leaders who, in turn, help to develop more up-and-coming leaders. ‚ÄúAutoZone‚Äôs Values and focus on impacting the community also enable me to connect with my community on a larger scale, helping to create healthier families, neighborhoods, and societies. This is my definition of true success.‚Äù   
  
In her free time, Ursula loves playing laser tag with her nieces and nephews and is the current reigning champ!

During the event, students engaged with Kiewit employees from across the organization, who shared insights about their career journeys at Kiewit. Eight attendees interned with us this past summer and are receiving scholarship support for the 2022-2023 school year.

Our Women in Kiewit and Legacy Minority Scholarships, launched in 2018 and 2019, respectively, have supported the collegiate careers of 33 students.

One happened early in the process, said Project Manager Tyler Jeziorski.

""The water table is roughly 8 feet below grade, so all of the underground utilities, pipe and electrical duct banks were all in that water table. When you have contaminated soil, you can‚Äôt simply discharge water off the site.""

""We had to essentially lower the water table locally and rotate it around the project while we installed the underground utilities and poured all the major foundations. To have adequate storage space to support these efforts, the team dug additional temporary retention ponds. It was a huge challenge for the job team to get that work done.""

This may come at the expense of thinking about longer-term goals, like retirement savings investments or child's college education. For the survey's full findings üëâ https://bit.ly/3TQzSbc

When PetSmart Charities first introduced the Everyday Adoption Centers in stores in 2010 to help more pets find homes, the hope was always that the programs would grow to do more than just create families, but to help keep them together.

The challenges many faces in obtaining access to veterinary care for their pets are one of the reasons PetSmart Charities works hard every day to equip their partners with the grants they need to help provide care for local communities. Partners like¬†Emancipet¬†have had an incredible impact in fighting the access to care gap.

We are honored to partner with the Emancipet team alongside PetSmart Charities to help bring this to life.

Today we are taking a tour around one of our Dutch offices - Hive in Wageningen.

Also known as the Foods Innovation Centre, Hive is the global Research & Development hub for many of our brands including Knorr, Hellmann's, and The Vegetarian Butcher. The location in Wageningen is no coincidence as the town sits at the heart of the world-renowned Food Valley!

Hive boasts more than 18,000m2 of area, including a built-in factory with a direct connection to the customer and food experience area. The material used for building the Wageningen office is approximately 30% recyclable, while its interiors use already recycled parts. 

The temperature inside is measured and adjusted based on the number of people present. In fact, the Innovation Centre has obtained the BREEAM-NL certification for architectural sustainability.

Victoria is leading many FLEX projects and creates opportunities for employees to learn more and develop themselves by strategically supporting projects all over the world.

As a Flex advocate, Victoria is an intermediator of Flex Experience and the people participating in it.

Working virtually makes connecting with people from other countries easier. She says ‚ÄúMy purpose is to create a playground for people to excel.""

Flex projects are a welcome addition to the ‚Äònew Unilever¬¥s normal‚Äô. Beyond where employees work, they can now use, test or grow their skill sets, assisting on new projects for a small or large proportion of time, increase the depth of their current skills or flexibly build new skills and experiences.

We are going #BehindTheJobTitle to meet Keshavi Puswewala our Senior Human Resources Business Partner, Corporate Functions & Talent & Organization and Employer Branding Lead - Sri Lanka.

üîπ Keshavi's role as the Employer Branding Lead for Unilever Sri Lanka focuses on working closely with the youth in the country. Here she not only builds constant engagements and touchpoints to empower youth from various fields but also strives in her role to inspire many undergraduates and students. She provides them with the opportunities and resources needed to gain better employability through skills and leadership development initiatives, helping them to discover their best selves and become future-fit.

üîπ One program that she looks forward to every year is 'The Youth Forum', where she gets to engage with the University Student Ambassadors, known as SPARKS, and connect with the wider undergraduate population in the market. The Youth Forum provides a platform for the youth to engage with each other and with renowned industry leaders, sharing their experiences on topics like purpose, wellbeing and diversity and inclusion.¬†

üí¨ Keshavi shares advice to those looking for a similar role, ‚ÄúEnable a culture of diversity, inclusion and belonging to bring out the best potential in everyone.

DO make sure it‚Äôs legit. Scammers see an opportunity to take advantage of your generosity so it‚Äôs important to do your homework before making a contribution.

DO trust your gut. Social engineering scams try to cash in on personal hardships and use scare tactics and a sense of urgency to get you to act quickly. 

DO look for reliable alternatives to make donations. It‚Äôs a good idea to search organization names on a charity watchdog site, like GuideStar and Charity Navigator.

DO protect your payments. The Federal Trade Commission recommends avoiding cash, gift cards, and money wires as payments, suggesting you stick to credit cards or checks instead.

6.98139e+18,29/09/2022 22:55,tektronix,302,6,"For #InventorsDay, we thought it fitting to recognize the lineage of inventors who have brought us to today's modern oscilloscopes.

Oscilloscope history begins in the 19th century when French Physicist Andre Blondel captured the first recorded waveforms on a galvanometer which detected changes in the current that was recorded by manually drawing a diagram of the wave formations.

William Duddell created the photographic oscillograph which used a mirror galvanometer that allowed waveforms to be measured and recorded directly.

In 1897 the cathode-ray tube, invented by Karl Ferdinand Braun, made it possible to record higher frequency measurements and led to the design of the first analog oscilloscope.

In 1946 Howard Vollum and Melvin Murdock developed the first triggered oscilloscope ‚Äî the Tektronix Model 511. It allowed for more precise measurements as the waveforms were displayed and then repeated to create a stronger graphed image.

Since then, oscilloscope development has grown exponentially. After 76 years, Tektronix is still the lead producer of oscilloscopes. Without innovators like Blondel, Duddell, Braun, Vollum, and Murdock, Tektronix would not be here today. Happy Inventors Day!
