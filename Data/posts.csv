Through research, testing and operational solutions, the consortium aims to provide industry-wide CCUS infrastructure to support the energy and chemicals sector by capturing CO2 emissions to utilize for making useful products like plastics and cement, or by transporting the CO2 to geological reservoirs in the Asia Pacific region for permanent and secure storage.
 
We believe that the future of energy is lower carbon.  This strategic alliance with like-minded collaborators will help us progress and advance the development of large-scale CCUS solutions in the Asia Pacific region for decades to come.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is expected to play an essential role in reducing carbon emissions in hard to abate, energy intensive industries like refining, petrochemical, power, cement, and steel. These new greenhouse gas assessment permits have the potential to expand Chevron's portfolio of CCS assets in the Asia-Pacific region.

Pam Stevens, Store Director in our Portland Division, has been on our team since 1988 and was diagnosed with Ductal Carcinoma in 2015.
 
Pam shares: “Hearing I had breast cancer was devastating, but I faced it head on and every day started with a positive attitude. I won't lie, it was the toughest thing I had ever been through.”
 
We’re thrilled to share that Pam has been cancer-free for over six years! She credits family, friends and teammates for showing up for her during diagnosis and treatment and for helping her put herself first.
 
“I had the best support team at Store #0400. I was determined to go through chemo and work as long as I could. I made it to my 3rd round out of 8. My Store Director, Tiffany Knottingham, is the most supportive manager that I could have had. She said, 'Pammy, you need to go and take care of yourself. We will all be waiting for you when you return to work.' I did return, 9 weeks later, and I am still here with a smile on my face.” 
 
Pam encourages those who have a loved one facing a cancer diagnosis to show up – no matter what. “Reach out and offer help or just show up. We all say ‘we are fine’ or ‘we don't need help’ but trust me, we are not. We do need you.”
 
Pam’s number one tip for you? “It can happen to anyone. Please get your mammograms. I was lucky and caught mine early. Don't wait because it may be too late.”
 
Pam, thank you for sharing your story. We are one team and we're glad you're part of our family. We're so happy to celebrate you today!

Helen Dalton has been part of the Albertsons Companies team for 11 years and currently works as Labor Relations Manager in our Southwest Division. Helen is a proud member of the Southwest Division’s Diversity and Inclusion Council as well as the Albertsons Pride Alliance ARG, and is an active volunteer with the ACI Crisis Response Team.

Helen recognizes the importance of resource groups such as the Pride Alliance and Diversity and Inclusion Council in the workplace. “For far too long, LGBTQ+ individuals had to compartmentalize themselves in order to be accepted in certain social and work environments. No one should ever have to hide or feel shame for who they are or who they love.

I encourage anyone and everyone at Albertsons Companies to join as many ARGs as possible. Share your story and truly listen to the stories of others. Realize your own subconscious biases and strive every day to overcome them. We are all in this together and together we can affect great change.”

Steve Henry (he/him/his) has been on the Albertsons Companies team for nearly 19 years, starting out pushing carts in the snowy New Hampshire weather and currently working as Director, Data Quality and Shelf Communication in our Pleasanton office.

Steve shares: “Pride is about two things for me: joy and being boldly, unapologetically visible. Many LGBTQ+ folks spend a portion or majority of their formative years (and beyond) hiding a piece of themselves from everyone around them and often (not always) that comes with a lot of shame.  Pride is about reclaiming space and rejecting the closet that held a lot of us back and continues to hold back others who can’t come out yet because they’re not ready or it’s not safe to do so.”

What does it mean to Steve to be a member of the LGBTQ+ community? 

""My journey is different than a straight person’s – just like my journey as a cisgendered man is very different from someone in the trans community. I get to see the world a bit differently because of that and I’m honestly super thankful that I do. I think it’s challenged me to be a better ally to other marginalized groups within the LGBTQ community and outside of it. It’s also allowed me to create a really wonderful chosen family in addition to my birth one (who are fantastic, too!).  I would never want to erase any part of me – including the less than great experiences – because I’m pretty proud of the gay man I’ve become and continue to become.""

""Work that Works gives me an unmatched level of flexibility; I have the freedom to plan my day and I feel a great sense of ownership and autonomy. I prioritize my office days for when in-person collaboration is essential, or on days where I don’t have back to back meetings, so I can engage and socialize with colleagues at the office. Working from home allows me to do more deep work undistracted and I have more time available to do things that normally would have been postponed to after office hours. Being at the office energizes me and helps me being more creative. To me the magic happens at the coffee machine, during lunch and at that impromptu brainstorming session where you’re leaning over a colleague’s desk to pick their brain on a problem you’ve been stuck with for days. Being able to choose the setting that makes me most productive is something I highly value and appreciate and I can’t imagine working in a different way.""

The current door is the old Ayres design with Renaissance glass, which was phased out many years ago, and replaced with the Georgia which features more discreet mouldings.
 
The door may have been installed back in 1997, but it still has that perfect ‘close’ that Rockdoor is synonymous with.

He’ll be missed by everyone within GAP, but also from a raft of customers that Karl has been involved with during his journey at GAP.
 
From manufacturing roles in the early days of door panels, through to depot management, Karl has excelled in whatever he was involved with.
 
During recent years though, it was Karl’s passion for installation, training and support that shone through, in particular for Rockdoors.
 
Lots of customers and teams members will have left Karl’s training sessions, not only more knowledgeable about installations and products, but they’ll have had a good time doing it too thanks to his personality and approach to learning. A natural trainer!!

1. Short-term disability insurance
Covers employees for around three to six months when a temporary covered illness or injury keeps them out of work.

2. Long-term disability insurance
Benefits can extend for years or even until employees reach retirement age, but usually pay out less than short-term policies and can be more costly.

3. Social Security Disability Insurance
Only covers employees who are completely unable to work due to a severe, long-term, total disability, if they have paid Social Security taxes.

4. Workers’ compensation insurance
Only covers workplace-sustained injuries or illnesses, with the company filing a claim on behalf of the employee with whomever processes claims in your state.

AI-Ready DigitalBoard: 

https://lnkd.in/g-G5HWsq

This is one of the latest AI innovation to help board directors assess and evaluate how effective their companies are. While the analytical contents are generated by Ai, the humans are still needed to explain to their stakeholders and connect with them on the issues highlighted and the action steps that need to be pursued.

These have been rolled out and used by PLC board directors globally: non-exec chairpersons, non-executive independent directors, risk committee heads, advisors to boards and more.

Four Interesting Facts of this AI System:

1. Can compress hundreds of pages of contents, into understandable format that is succinct and clear. You can also make request to modify the format and add your own parameters.

2. Covers implications of business and financial strategies, risk assessment, six capitals (integrated reporting), sentiment analysis surrounding the organisation, leadership profile / traits and comparing against top leaders and more.

3. For boardroom size of 5, 7 9 , 11 and 13 (directors), the report cost per director is lower than the price of an intern's pay, and even so for a CFO - to give you foresight and recommendations based on internal and external dynamics of the firm.

4. It has been successfully forward and back tested on thousands of companies that experienced credit downgrades, defaults or fundamental issues.

We recently attended The AQR Safety Guidance webinar which
provided practical insights into keeping researchers safe. Our key takeaways from the newly published guidance are:
 
- Always check in with researchers before and after qualitative
fieldwork (especially when in-person!)
 
- Make space for concerns to be raised and addressed before
fieldwork begins
 
- Create a checklist for preparing for all qualitative fieldwork
 
- Personal characteristics of researchers e.g., gender, ethnicity,
sexuality can affect their experience conducting research. Check if people are comfortable working on projects and allow them to express their feelings of
discomfort.
 
As our work at Progressive spans a wide range of fields, from going into prisons to exploring personal health needs with seldom heard groups, this guidance will be an invaluable reference point for us when undertaking qual research in future.

3946,6.90439e+18,01/03/2022 11:44,progressive,4,0,"Sustainability and protecting our planet are ongoing and pressing topics. I cast my mind back to November 2021, when I attended the Market Research Society (MRS) Sustainability Summit. This was full-day virtual event. The day consisted of panel discussions, guest speakers and presentations of findings; all revolving around the topic of sustainability. Each of the sessions lasted around 30 minutes, the guests would then do a Q&A with the host, using questions posted on the live chat by attendees. It was an interactive day with lots of interesting things discussed, some of which I’ve picked out below. 

Key messages:
One of the most interesting factors affecting progress towards a sustainable future was the gap between action and intention, sometimes called the ‘say-do’ gap. Ipsos Mori have identified this gap as the biggest factor affecting people’s behaviour. There is also a call for more research to be done on people’s current actions rather than what they would like to achieve in the future. It will give a real insight into our current situation and how far we’ve got to go.

Another key insight was that changes in consumer behaviour can be linked to how a brand or product is perceived. People like to know their purchase is having a direct, positive impact on the environment, such as trees planted after you buy a certain product. This lends itself to the authenticity of brands but is also open to a key criticism of businesses: ‘green washing’. Green washing is the perception that brands do not back up their claims around green activities with concrete actions. Certain products seem sustainable and environmentally friendly but are having the opposite effect and are marketed to deceive the consumer.

How we will react -
As an industry, we need to reflect on these key messages, and put our actions into practice. It’s really about the small steps and then the big things take care of themselves.

Hope you enjoy the read and it sheds new light on this widely discussed topic.
Here are some of the key messages from the seminar:
•	As a collective, we need a change of perception and behaviour to allow us to move forward in a way that doesn’t damage our future.
•	On a companies’ website, the sustainability page is second most visited. Consumers are often “choosing the sustainable option”, giving businesses that have strong sustainability credentials a competitive advantage. 
•	Businesses can conduct a ‘lifecycle analysis’ to understand what contributes to their carbon footprint. They can use this to look at what needs to change and create solutions accordingly. 
•	You can be the catalyst for change, and you can make the difference.

3953,6.85916e+18,27/10/2021 15:54,progressive,2,0,"Jonnie, one of our Execs, ran his first-ever focus groups last week – brand testing for a charity relaunching its branding assets.
 
Here are his (mostly practical) do's and don'ts for any online focus groups you might be running in the near future:
 
Do: write the ‘live’ time you expect to finish each section of the topic/discussion guide. So, if you are running a group that lasts one hour, starts at 6pm, and the first section of the topic guide lasts 10 minutes, stick 6-6.10pm in the margin! Do this for each section of your topic guide. This will help you stay on track, meaning you won’t need to rush the backend of the guide (which can often be the most critical!)
 
Do: make sure you have a way of telling the time, such as a phone or watch. You need it to stay on track, but it’s particularly important if you are moderating groups online and sharing content for the discussion because you may not be able to see the time whilst sharing your screen.
 
Do: log on to the call early. This will give you enough time to make sure that the call is recording properly, you are able to share stimulus, and test anything that requires more technical setup (such as sharing your computer’s audio for any TV and radio adverts). It also gives you time to settle and practice your opening lines!
 
Don’t: try to take detailed notes and moderate at the same time. If you’re recording the group, focus on being attentive to what is being said and probe accordingly – you can always listen back to the recording to clarify your understanding of certain points and pick out quotes. If you’re not recording the interview, it could be worth seeing if a colleague would be free to help you out with notetaking!
 
Don’t: spend too much time on introductions and warm up. It can be easy to get carried away with ‘where do you live?’ and ‘what do you do for a living?’ type questions, but it’s good to get into the main discussion as soon as possible. If you feel your group participants are spending too long on their introductions, reiterate that you’re just after a brief one/two-line intro.

While being a part of the foundational success of AZ WIN (AutoZone's Women's Initiative) almost 8 years ago, she recently helped launch the newest BRG in support of the LGBTQIA+ community, AZ PRIDE+. She credits the Business Resource Groups (BRGs) for fostering safe spaces for all AutoZoners. 
 
When Jill is not in the office, she immerses herself in the vibrant music culture of Memphis. She enjoys spending time with her wife, Taylor, as they prepare for their first child expected to arrive in August 2022.
 
 Jill says “AutoZoners have and openly embraced me from a college intern to now an expecting mother and experienced professional in the workplace. Likewise, my AutoZone family has also embraced my big smile, worry-free laugh, and permanently optimistic outlook.  They are my village, and I have truly found my home here.”

In celebration of Women’s History Month, we would like to spotlight, Ursula Lee, Co-Chair of AZ WIN, AutoZone's Women’s Business Resource Group. Ursula is a seven-year AutoZoner who has grown her career in Commercial credit from Administrator to her current position as Manager.  Ursula believes it is important to bring all the elements of who you are to work and employs this philosophy in leading her team and in participating in philanthropy. She also believes this is critical to networking within an inclusive and diverse workplace and to facilitating her own personal and professional development. 
 
AutoZone places an immense focus on supporting AutoZoners and the Greater Memphis community which closely aligns with her personal mission of being a helper of people.  Ursula is a Board member of the AutoZoner Assistance Fund (AAF), a nonprofit organization established to support fellow AutoZoners who experience short-term emergency funding needs resulting from natural disasters and personal tragedies. Ursula states, she is proudest when she sees AutoZoners whom she has helped develop, grow into successful and supportive leaders who, in turn, help to develop more up-and-coming leaders. “AutoZone’s Values and focus on impacting the community also enable me to connect with my community on a larger scale, helping to create healthier families, neighborhoods, and societies. This is my definition of true success.”   
  
In her free time, Ursula loves playing laser tag with her nieces and nephews and is the current reigning champ!

MRC also provides site leaders and managers with training on how to best support employees and create a successful environment.

This fed into bigger trends like the great resignation – as many decided that life was just too short to settle for a job that they dreaded every day.
These people were searching for a greater sense of purpose.
But don’t mix up the search for purpose with the question of whether you should love your job – you’ll have to check out last week’s blog for that! Although yes, the NASA cleaner we finished that article with, was a great example of finding purpose! 
Research quoted in a recent Mckinsey & Company article found that purposeful people live longer and healthier lives – and are even less likely to suffer from dementia.

This is said to be due to a Native American belief that no building should be taller than a tree – so placing the tree on top of the building resolves that, while symbolizing growth and bringing luck. Our thanks to our partners Turner Construction Company, CRB Group, and Foundation Steel LLC, whose teams have kept our site safe and our construction on time. “Installing the final beam is a huge milestone in this journey, and I am so proud to celebrate this achievement!

“On the team we have people from all walks of life and that has brought a lot of good perspective and good ideas forward on the project,” said Construction Manager Eric Johanson. “We’ve rolled out many trainings on respect, inclusion, equity and building a harassment-free culture, which has helped make this project a positive place to work. When people feel heard and included, they want to come to work and perform at their best and that’s been critical to our success.”

Eight attendees interned with us this past summer and are receiving scholarship support for the 2022-2023 school year.

Our Women in Kiewit and Legacy Minority Scholarships, launched in 2018 and 2019, respectively, have supported the collegiate careers of 33 students.

Construction is planned to begin in 2023, and the plant will create 100+ long-term, high-value manufacturing jobs. 

This investment cements our long-term commitment to the Canadian market. It will help our customers build faster, smarter, and more sustainably. Best of all, our CGC customers will, for the first time, have access to our industry-leading Sheetrock® EcoSmart brand gypsum wallboard.

A big thanks to our customers, employees, and all of the people that worked to make this happen, including Wheatland County Reeve Amber Link, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney, Minister of Agriculture, Forestry, and Rural Economic Development Nate Horner; Spaar CEO Clifford Francis; and Invest Alberta CEO Rick Christiaanse. 

This is a win for all of us.

I lived in Rio Rico, AZ (which is just outside of the Mexico border) until I was 18, when I first moved to Tempe, AZ. It was kind of a culture shock because suddenly I was surrounded by so many different cultures. 

That first day at Starbucks was just the beginning of feeling like it was my new home. Soon, so many other Latinx customers would come in and I was able to communicate with them in Spanish and English. It’s helped me connect with them in a deeper way.

Now, I work with so many people from different cultures. It is so awesome to share our differences, and all come together working for a company we love.

I just feel extremely thankful for working at Starbucks because I don't see it as just a job--I see it as my career. I wake up every morning and I'm just so excited to come to work. I love building confidence for my team, helping them also move up with the company. 

This Latinx Heritage Month, I'm reflecting on my pride to be the daughter of a single working mom. I'm so proud of her for coming to the states at such a young age. Without my mom, I wouldn’t be where I am today. This month reminds me of how hard my mom worked in order for my siblings and I to live the American dream.

Three years ago, I started my career at Starbucks as a part time barista. I was only looking for something small to get out of the house while my kids were at school; in turn I quickly fell in love with the company and became a shift supervisor a year later. When I heard about the Starbucks College Achievement Plan (SCAP), which would allow me to get my first-time bachelor’s degree online with 100% upfront tuition coverage, I knew this was my chance to try. This fall I am beginning my fourth semester online at Arizona State University.

Today, SCAP is making my dream of earning a college degree come true. I never imagined I would get the opportunity like this, especially later in life. My kids get to see me accomplishing work goals as well as personal life goals I’ve always had. They are now some of my biggest supporters and cheerleaders.

SCAP is expanding on career goals I previously didn’t think was even a possibility, and my degree will help me advance my career in leadership so that one day soon I can lead my own store. 

I cannot wait to see what the future holds and where my story takes me.""

I live my day to day with Severe Social Anxiety coupled with post-traumatic stress disorder, significant hearing loss, limited mobility in my left hand due to reconstructive surgeries, as well as Osgood-Schlatter’s Disease which limits my mobility. During my time in the US Marine Corps, I also suffered a traumatic brain injury which has led to short-term memory loss.

Beyond the lifelong impacts of my time in the Corps I also am a person living with Asperger’s Syndrome. I have changed my day-to-day life to accommodate some of the unique obstacles this may present, and my partners (employees) are all incredibly supportive of me and the challenges that may occur due to how my mind works.  

In all my years of employment, I have never felt a stronger sense of belonging to something important aside from my military service— until Starbucks. Starbucks has given me the opportunity to positively impact others in a meaningful way. 

This Disability Pride Month, I am reflecting on our growing awareness of how many people think and feel differently, and how that brings more acceptance toward those who think in unique ways. Whether it is trauma that someone is dealing with, or a loss that someone is working through— sharing our journeys brings that awareness to it.

Our mission “To inspire and nurture the human spirit, one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time” is a mantra I believe in. I have become the type of person that wants to go to work even during my off time. Starbucks fulfills that promise of what it wants to be, and that allows me to be who I am.”

I started my journey with Starbucks in 2004 as a Barista. Within three years, at the age of 23, I was opening and managing a store. It was my pride and joy. 

After eight years, I hung up the green apron. I needed to tell stories. In the years that followed, I earned my M.A. in Journalism from Columbia College Chicago, worked in news media in Chicago and the Twin Cities, managed storytelling at a global nonprofit and gained corporate communications experience at a [Electronics Company]. 

While working at a nonprofit, I even went back to Starbucks as a part-time shift supervisor. Now, I am proud to write stories for [a Healthcare Technology] employee audience. My experience in journalism, nonprofit and corporate communications is built on a foundation of skills I learned as a store manager for Starbucks.

To Jenny, the partners she’s met at Starbucks are her family, guiding and supporting her since she started at Starbucks in 1995.
 
Originally starting as a barista, Jenny is now a district manager in California and a leader of the Pan-Asian Pacific Network (PPN), one of many partner-led communities that bring those with shared experiences and identities across Starbucks together. For Jenny, the community has brought a deeper understanding to the importance of hearing people’s stories as well as sharing her own as a Vietnamese American.
 
“Every culture and every community has gone through pain, celebration, and love. All those feelings are the same,” Jenny says. “Listening to someone’s story creates a more inclusive environment, because it creates a sense of unity, allowing us to learn more about everyone else so we can be more accepting.”
 
Throughout her journey at Starbucks, Jenny has gotten married, had four children, and over the last few years, questioned what might be next for her career. In the end, when she thought of the community of people who supported her through it all, the answer was Starbucks. 
 
“When my dad passed away, my partners that had worked for me over the years and the community, including my RVP, all showed up at my dad's funeral…” Jenny recalls. “As I'm thinking about that, I had just an overpouring [feeling] of, this is where I'm supposed to be.”

“I think it’s my responsibility as a leader to be a role model for partners who don’t always feel they have a voice…” she said. “You can’t just show up to LGBTQIA2+ events, you have to show up to any event with who you are because that is visibility.

At the time I was a new high school graduate, anxious about starting a new job, scared to begin my college journey at my local community college, lost from the recent death of a parent, and confused with all the choice and opportunities ahead of me.
 
Over the years, many aspects of my life have changed. My father has been my absolute greatest, most supporting, patient and impactful person in my SCAP journey. He never went to college and knew he couldn’t always help me in the way that I needed. Yet, he was the only person who would stay up sitting at the kitchen table in silence while I try to write a paper, sobbing because I felt so defeated.
 
My father impacted by SCAP journey by unconditionally supporting me and reassuring me that failure oftentimes leads to new beginnings, hard times never last forever and it doesn’t matter how long it takes you to finish the race – as long as you finish and believe that you’ve already won.
 
[Today, 5 years later since starting at Starbucks] I realized my SCAP journey isn’t just saying I have a piece of paper to prove I’m educated, intelligent and worthy. Rather, my journey, jobs, relationships, and hardships are leaving a lasting impact on myself and the world around me. I am in fact an educated, intelligent and worthy—sometimes it just takes a push into the unknown to figure that out.”

6655,6.91243e+18,23/03/2022 16:05,starbucks,1008,90,"For Gena, being a woman in the workplace sometimes feels like a balancing act.

“Can we show emotion? If we are stern and firm will people receive that well? Do I need to dress a certain way?” she said. “On top of that, how can I be me? To me, it comes down to having the courage to be authentically you…often times we are expected to not bring a lot of that into work, but [ultimately] we are mothers, we are partners, we are sisters, we are daughters.”

As a 4-year partner, Director of Delivery in Digital Customer Experiences, co-chair of Starbucks Black Partner Network (BPN), and member of the Women's Impact Network (WIN), Gena has been defining what it means to be a changemaker and leader in the workplace. 

“There were times where I wondered where I would fit in…as I’ve progressed in my career, I’ve gained a certain level of confidence to just let myself show up as I am.” 

But she didn’t do it alone. Being raised by her late mother and growing up with three sisters created a strong support system as her foundation. As she got older, playing basketball grew her circle even more, giving her coaches and teams of diverse woman to learn from and grow with.

Today, she encourages her own teams to be the change they want to see. 

“Be an entrepreneur in terms of creating that space and environment. If you don’t feel [included], someone else probably also feels that way. By putting yourself out there you’re creating an impact in how different people may think about initiating change.”

As a 17-year partner (employee), Zabrina sometimes wonders if she would still be practicing law had she not decided to leave her firm for Starbucks. Her move was largely influenced by mentors helping guide her along the way.

“Law is a male dominated profession. I was attracted to Starbucks because the general counsel back then was an African American woman – one of three or four at a Fortune 500 company at that time,"" she said. ""Having someone who looked like me, who was a leader, who could understand and relate to the issues that I had faced and encountered, was inspiring and helped me grow as a professional and taught me a lot about being a business leader at a company.”

For Zabrina, the responsibility to mentor others was something she learned growing up. Today, some of her mentorship is given through her executive sponsorship of the Black Partner Network at Starbucks, which brings many Black partners together to connect, serve communities and support one another.

“At Starbucks, [our] company values align with my own—I’ve always said, if there comes a day where the company’s values and mine are not aligned, it’s time for me to leave. It’s a place where I can continue to grow and have a number of opportunities and still feel like my personal value system is honored.”

For those who may be uncertain but aspire to practice law, Zabrina advises “Do your homework and make an informed decision. Don’t let your fears keep you from reaching your goal.”

As a first generation Nigerian American whose parents immigrated before he was born, Andrew faced challenges throughout his life where he was reminded of who he was, and who he wasn’t.
 
Visiting Nigeria for the first time at 9 years old, Andrew was humbled and inspired seeing where his parents came from. But during their time there, Andrew’s 12 year old brother developed malaria and after returning home to America, he passed away. Andrew watched how his parents remained dedicated to their faith, gaining strength and support during the difficult time.
 
“[It inspired] a strong belief in something bigger than myself. I would say that's the most tangible and pivotal thing that led from there. But also, I think [it put] just a hunger in me—being the only boy in the family, realizing I'm carrying on a legacy.”
 
Since then, Andrew has been dedicated to studying business, leadership and equity in the workplace and leading Starbucks licensed stores in the Indianapolis area. His passion for people and work culture has inspired his career as well as his authored book: The Circle of Leadership. For Andrew, being a good leader is about showing people empathy.
 
“[I want to have] awareness of who I'm talking to, what their struggles are, their backgrounds, I think that's important. Finding moments to create a safe space to open up and have some of those conversations and asking, ‘how are you really doing?’”
 
To Andrew, this behavior matches Starbucks Mission and Values. “They're not just words that go on a wall or in a handbook. They're really trying to inspire and nurture the human spirit and take care of their partners.”

“Don’t take your talent to a company who wants it because they need it,” says 14-year partner (employee), Dennis. “I want you to go to companies who did the work when I was coming up. I want you to reward your talent to the companies who have been doing this work, and not the companies who want your talent because they have no other choice, [because] they need you now.”
 
As the U.S. becomes more diverse, Dennis predicts that companies who didn’t prioritize #InclusionAndDiversity will struggle to survive.
 
“Inclusion and diversity is business imperative. It’s so important because of our partners, customers, communities and investors. If companies aren’t doing the work today, in this space, I truly believe those companies will not be in existence 20 years from now because they will not have the talent,” Dennis says.

“My mental health feels strong when I am actively taking care of myself. Through therapy, self-reflection, fantastic support networks, and hard work, I’ve learned what makes me tick and what I need to personally do to feel mentally strong!! When I’m engaging in my passions and hobbies I feel super mentally strong.

Working at PetSmart has allowed me to gain even more confidence and I consider going into work such a positive as well. Learn about yourself, seek help when you need it and never stop learning and growing and improving, build that mental strength!!”"

👋 Meet Kyle: Store Leader at Georgetown PetSmart 
“I seek to support others' mental health by actively listening. As a leader, it is very easy to assign tasks, tell people what needs to be done or give business updates, but we sometimes lose focus on the most important part of any good business and that is the people running it. I always try to stay mindful of how others may be feeling and I have an open-door policy with all of my associates. Getting to know our associates on a little more personal level, learning about their families, favourite activities or past personal experiences allows us to create a warm, welcoming environment within our store.”

Thank you for all of your support, Kyle! We appreciate you so much and are thankful to have such a supportive leader within our pack. 🤩

When PetSmart Charities first introduced the Everyday Adoption Centers in stores in 2010 to help more pets find homes, the hope was always that the programs would grow to do more than just create families, but to help keep them together.

The challenges many faces in obtaining access to veterinary care for their pets are one of the reasons PetSmart Charities works hard every day to equip their partners with the grants they need to help provide care for local communities. Partners like Emancipet have had an incredible impact in fighting the access to care gap.

We are honored to partner with the Emancipet team alongside PetSmart Charities to help bring this to life. We're grateful to our PetSmart Charities team members and our PetSmart store associates for their dedication to pets and all who love them. We're proud of the work our partners do every day to make an impact.

And we're so thankful for YOU—the pet lovers, advocates, and donors who make this all possible.

Here she not only builds constant engagements and touchpoints to empower youth from various fields but also strives in her role to inspire many undergraduates and students. She provides them with the opportunities and resources needed to gain better employability through skills and leadership development initiatives, helping them to discover their best selves and become future-fit.

🔹 One program that she looks forward to every year is 'The Youth Forum', where she gets to engage with the University Student Ambassadors, known as SPARKS, and connect with the wider undergraduate population in the market. The Youth Forum provides a platform for the youth to engage with each other and with renowned industry leaders, sharing their experiences on topics like purpose, wellbeing and diversity and inclusion. 

💬 Keshavi shares advice to those looking for a similar role, “Enable a culture of diversity, inclusion and belonging to bring out the best potential in everyone. Fostering an inclusive environment is vital as an HR professional in order to create a space of psychological safety. Hence, self-reflect to improve on your strengths, build these traits and cultivate the right habits and behaviors from an early stage to bring your best self in everyday!”

They help veterans successfully transition after military service by identifying their education, employment, and healthcare needs, as well as connecting them to available community, state, and federal resources.
 
Thank you to all who have served, and continue to serve, within our military.

To show our support, Belk recently donated a total of $10,000 across three Charlotte, NC- area organizations chosen by Valor: Veterans Bridge Home, a non-profit dedicated to supporting the transition of military members exiting the service by connecting them to available community, state, and federal resources; Suit Up Charlotte, an organization that provides a network of support for veterans; and Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) Post 2423.
 
We thank all veterans for your selfless sacrifice, for suppressing your own fears so that we never have to live in fear, and for the many times you were away from your family so the rest of us could be safe with our families.

After the gift cards are sent, the individual states the gift cards do not work and will give the customer instructions that lead to the customer calling fraudulent phone numbers. The final goal is for the customer to scan a QR code at a Bitcoin ATM at which point their account is drained. Stay Alert!

DO make sure it’s legit. Scammers see an opportunity to take advantage of your generosity so it’s important to do your homework before making a contribution.

DO trust your gut. Social engineering scams try to cash in on personal hardships and use scare tactics and a sense of urgency to get you to act quickly. 

DO look for reliable alternatives to make donations. It’s a good idea to search organization names on a charity watchdog site, like GuideStar and Charity Navigator.

DO protect your payments. The Federal Trade Commission recommends avoiding cash, gift cards, and money wires as payments, suggesting you stick to credit cards or checks instead.

Through his 40+ years at Flowserve, he has grown into an expert in pump mechanics and taken his expertise to several of our U.S. sites.  

Robert specializes in vertical pumps used for power plants and significant water applications. As soon as a pump comes into the site, he takes it apart, cleans the pump, inspects the pump, and creates a report about the condition of the pump.  

“Vertical pumps are my specialty, but I’ll also jump in and help with balancing impellers and assembly. For me, it’s fun to stay busy and switch focus between different parts.

He participated in several Flowserve training opportunities to grow in his career and was promoted to Industrial Engineer. Serving in this role gave him an even broader view of how our products are created end-to-end and prepared him for success in his current role as Project Coordinator.  

As a Project Coordinator, Jeroen connects the needs of our customers with the innovation of our teams to deliver fast results.  

“In my role I monitor the financial status and the lead time of my projects. I’m also responsible for the contact with the customers and suppliers. I keep them updated on the process and make sure our orders are delivered on time with the highest standards of quality. Our lead times are short, but we have a team of experts, so we accomplish a lot in a short amount of time.”  
Jeroen attributes the team's success to the relationships they have built and their willingness to help each other.

Oscilloscope history begins in the 19th century when French Physicist Andre Blondel captured the first recorded waveforms on a galvanometer which detected changes in the current that was recorded by manually drawing a diagram of the wave formations.

William Duddell created the photographic oscillograph which used a mirror galvanometer that allowed waveforms to be measured and recorded directly.

In 1897 the cathode-ray tube, invented by Karl Ferdinand Braun, made it possible to record higher frequency measurements and led to the design of the first analog oscilloscope.

In 1946 Howard Vollum and Melvin Murdock developed the first triggered oscilloscope — the Tektronix Model 511. It allowed for more precise measurements as the waveforms were displayed and then repeated to create a stronger graphed image.

Since then, oscilloscope development has grown exponentially. After 76 years, Tektronix is still the lead producer of oscilloscopes. Without innovators like Blondel, Duddell, Braun, Vollum, and Murdock, Tektronix would not be here today. Happy Inventors Day!

The collection features a 6-Inch Rubber Toe Boot crafted with responsibly sourced olive green nubuck Better Leather and bold, rubber toe caps & overlays for added durability. In the collaboration, nostalgic cues flow from the footwear into the apparel with our classic, high pile Bee Line X Timberland® fleece jacket and pants made of 100% recycled fleece, reimagined with a nostalgic 90’s geometric print. 
 
We highlighted this collaboration in a special campaign featuring NYC OG and music artist, Jadakiss and NYC native and multidisciplinary creative, Aurora Anthony. It nods to the affinity that has grown amongst urban city dwellers towards the Timberland® boot – which to many, is the symbolic representation of the grind and dedication it takes to make it in a big city.

​​
With a goal of cultivating and advancing BIPOC talent within the footwear industry, DiverCity x DESIGN presents a rare opportunity for five individuals to undergo a year-long apprenticeship learning everything there is to know about footwear design while experiencing the unique cultures at three VF brands: Timberland, Vans and The North Face. ​​
​​
One project had these talented designers share their vision of a Timberland boot for our upcoming 50th anniversary, with the unique experience of having their prototypes produced. At the end of the rotation, with guidance and support from assigned mentor teams, each presented their final concept to senior leadership, who were duly impressed.​
 ​
The DiverCity x DESIGN program is a key element of Timberland’s commitment to The Work of creating a more inclusive and equitable future, through design education and other community-building programs. Learn more about our commitments at https://lnkd.in/g2Vywxs.​

It has been an amazing experience for the apprentices as well as all the Timberland team members involved. We wish them all the best as they head to Vans next. Keep an eye out for future VF x Pensole partnerships.​"

Nearly 50 years ago, Timberland built a boot to keep workers warm and dry against the harshest New England weather. It was unlike any boot, and it was made to get things done. But the credit for making the Original Yellow Boot an icon goes to the communities around the world who made it their own. These communities, anchored by an inspiring :60-second film anthem narrated by rapper Westside Gunn and featuring notable New Yorkers Meyhem Lauren and Nicolas “NY Nico” Heller. The film touches on where we’ve come from to the brand we are today, and calls on people everywhere to build forward, together."
