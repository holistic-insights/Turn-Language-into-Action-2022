Pam Stevens, Store Director in our Portland Division, has been on our team since 1988 and was diagnosed with Ductal Carcinoma in 2015.
 
Pam shares: ‚ÄúHearing I had breast cancer was devastating, but I faced it head on and every day started with a positive attitude. I won't lie, it was the toughest thing I had ever been through.‚Äù
 
We‚Äôre thrilled to share that Pam has been cancer-free for over six years! She credits family, friends and teammates for showing up for her during diagnosis and treatment and for helping her put herself first.
 
‚ÄúI had the best support team at Store #0400. I was determined to go through chemo and work as long as I could. I made it to my 3rd round out of 8. My Store Director, Tiffany Knottingham, is the most supportive manager that I could have had. She said, 'Pammy, you need to go and take care of yourself. We will all be waiting for you when you return to work.' I did return, 9 weeks later, and I am still here with a smile on my face.‚Äù 
 
Pam encourages those who have a loved one facing a cancer diagnosis to show up ‚Äì no matter what. ‚ÄúReach out and offer help or just show up. We all say ‚Äòwe are fine‚Äô or ‚Äòwe don't need help‚Äô but trust me, we are not. We do need you.‚Äù
 
Pam‚Äôs number one tip for you? ‚ÄúIt can happen to anyone. Please get your mammograms. I was lucky and caught mine early. Don't wait because it may be too late.‚Äù
 
Pam, thank you for sharing your story. We are one team and we're glad you're part of our family. We're so happy to celebrate you today!

""Work that Works gives me an unmatched level of flexibility; I have the freedom to plan my day and I feel a great sense of ownership and autonomy. I prioritize my office days for when in-person collaboration is essential, or on days where I don‚Äôt have back to back meetings, so I can engage and socialize with colleagues at the office. Working from home allows me to do more deep work undistracted and I have more time available to do things that normally would have been postponed to after office hours. Being at the office energizes me and helps me being more creative. To me the magic happens at the coffee machine, during lunch and at that impromptu brainstorming session where you‚Äôre leaning over a colleague‚Äôs desk to pick their brain on a problem you‚Äôve been stuck with for days. Being able to choose the setting that makes me most productive is something I highly value and appreciate and I can‚Äôt imagine working in a different way.""

We have a diverse portfolio of digital, pharmacy, behavioral, clinical and complex care solutions that are offered through our current services businesses and government business.

It‚Äôs through all of our assets that we are able to focus on serving people across the entire care journey, connecting them to the care, support, and resources they need to lead healthy lives. It‚Äôs also how we are able to deliver on our strategy, exceed expectations for our consumers, and drive growth for our shareholders. 

Equipped with digital capabilities, data, and resources, we are uniquely able to champion a whole health approach and advance health beyond healthcare for our consumers, their families, and our communities. Elevance Health better reflects our business and the company we are today.

The funds from this year‚Äôs campaign will be donated to local food banks benefiting veterans, service members, their families, and local communities. 

‚ÄúHumana and the VFW created the Uniting to Combat Hunger campaign in 2018 to make sure Veterans and their families across the country get the nutritious foods they need,‚Äù said Edward Sandrick, Humana‚Äôs Director of the Veterans Channel. ‚ÄúThis collaboration is a great example of how Humana and the VFW have been working together for 10 years toward our shared goal of removing barriers to good health for Veterans and their families nationwide. We want to thank all of the VFWs who got involved.‚Äù  

Committed to supporting Veterans‚Äô health, Humana also donated $50,000 to two VFW programs that provide financial aid to veterans to help with basic needs such as paying rent and that helps veterans access their earned Veterans Affairs benefits and compensation.

‚ÄúWe are incredibly shocked and saddened to learn of the senseless loss of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the longest serving prime minister in Japan. Prime Minister Abe will be long remembered for his dedication to improving Japan‚Äôs economy and his steadfast commitment to providing a woman-friendly work environment through his ‚Äòwomenomics‚Äô policy, which sparked a national call to action to promote more women into leadership positions throughout Japan, a policy that was warmly embraced by Aflac Incorporated.

1. Short-term disability insurance
Covers employees for around three to six months when a temporary covered illness or injury keeps them out of work.

2. Long-term disability insurance
Benefits can extend for years or even until employees reach retirement age, but usually pay out less than short-term policies and can be more costly.

3. Social Security Disability Insurance
Only covers employees who are completely unable to work due to a severe, long-term, total disability, if they have paid Social Security taxes.

4. Workers‚Äô compensation insurance
Only covers workplace-sustained injuries or illnesses, with the company filing a claim on behalf of the employee with whomever processes claims in your state.

This is one of the latest AI innovation to help board directors assess and evaluate how effective their companies are. While the analytical contents are generated by Ai, the humans are still needed to explain to their stakeholders and connect with them on the issues highlighted and the action steps that need to be pursued.

These have been rolled out and used by PLC board directors globally: non-exec chairpersons, non-executive independent directors, risk committee heads, advisors to boards and more.

Four Interesting Facts of this AI System:

1. Can compress hundreds of pages of contents, into understandable format that is succinct and clear. You can also make request to modify the format and add your own parameters.

2. Covers implications of business and financial strategies, risk assessment, six capitals (integrated reporting), sentiment analysis surrounding the organisation, leadership profile / traits and comparing against top leaders and more.

3. For boardroom size of 5, 7 9 , 11 and 13 (directors), the report cost per director is lower than the price of an intern's pay, and even so for a CFO - to give you foresight and recommendations based on internal and external dynamics of the firm.

4. It has been successfully forward and back tested on thousands of companies that experienced credit downgrades, defaults or fundamental issues.

¬†
We recently attended The AQR Safety Guidance webinar which
provided practical insights into keeping researchers safe. Our key takeaways from the newly published guidance are:
¬†
- Always check in with researchers before and after qualitative
fieldwork (especially when in-person!)
¬†
- Make space for concerns to be raised and addressed before
fieldwork begins
¬†
- Create a checklist for preparing for all qualitative fieldwork
¬†
- Personal characteristics of researchers e.g., gender, ethnicity,
sexuality can affect their experience conducting research. Check if people are comfortable working on projects and allow them to express their feelings of
discomfort.

As our work at Progressive spans a wide range of fields, from going into prisons to exploring personal health needs with seldom heard groups, this guidance will be an invaluable reference point for us when undertaking qual research in future.

6904390818971684864,2022-03-01 11:44:08,progressive,4,0,"Sustainability and protecting our planet are ongoing and pressing topics. I cast my mind back to November 2021, when I attended the Market Research Society (MRS) Sustainability Summit. This was full-day virtual event. The day consisted of panel discussions, guest speakers and presentations of findings; all revolving around the topic of sustainability. Each of the sessions lasted around 30 minutes, the guests would then do a Q&A with the host, using questions posted on the live chat by attendees. It was an interactive day with lots of interesting things discussed, some of which I‚Äôve picked out below. 

Key messages:
One of the most interesting factors affecting progress towards a sustainable future was the gap between action and intention, sometimes called the ‚Äòsay-do‚Äô gap. Ipsos Mori have identified this gap as the biggest factor affecting people‚Äôs behaviour. There is also a call for more research to be done on people‚Äôs current actions rather than what they would like to achieve in the future. It will give a real insight into our current situation and how far we‚Äôve got to go.

Another key insight was that changes in consumer behaviour can be linked to how a brand or product is perceived. People like to know their purchase is having a direct, positive impact on the environment, such as trees planted after you buy a certain product. This lends itself to the authenticity of brands but is also open to a key criticism of businesses: ‚Äògreen washing‚Äô. Green washing is the perception that brands do not back up their claims around green activities with concrete actions. Certain products seem sustainable and environmentally friendly but are having the opposite effect and are marketed to deceive the consumer.

How we will react -
As an industry, we need to reflect on these key messages, and put our actions into practice. It‚Äôs really about the small steps and then the big things take care of themselves.

¬†
Here are his (mostly practical) do's and don'ts for any online focus groups you might be running in the near future:
¬†
Do: write the ‚Äòlive‚Äô time you expect to finish each section of the topic/discussion guide. So, if you are running a group that lasts one hour, starts at 6pm, and the first section of the topic guide lasts 10 minutes, stick 6-6.10pm in the margin! Do this for each section of your topic guide. This will help you stay on track, meaning you won‚Äôt need to rush the backend of the guide (which can often be the most critical!)
¬†
Do: make sure you have a way of telling the time, such as a phone or watch. You need it to stay on track, but it‚Äôs particularly important if you are moderating groups online and sharing content for the discussion because you may not be able to see the time whilst sharing your screen.
¬†
Do: log on to the call early. This will give you enough time to make sure that the call is recording properly, you are able to share stimulus, and test anything that requires more technical setup (such as sharing your computer‚Äôs audio for any TV and radio adverts). It also gives you time to settle and practice your opening lines!
¬†
Don‚Äôt: try to take detailed notes and moderate at the same time. If you‚Äôre recording the group, focus on being attentive to what is being said and probe accordingly ‚Äì you can always listen back to the recording to clarify your understanding of certain points and pick out quotes. If you‚Äôre not recording the interview, it could be worth seeing if a colleague would be free to help you out with notetaking!
¬†
Don‚Äôt: spend too much time on introductions and warm up. It can be easy to get carried away with ‚Äòwhere do you live?‚Äô and ‚Äòwhat do you do for a living?‚Äô type questions, but it‚Äôs good to get into the main discussion as soon as possible. If you feel your group participants are spending too long on their introductions, reiterate that you‚Äôre just after a brief one/two-line intro.

¬†
We recently attended The AQR Safety Guidance webinar which
provided practical insights into keeping researchers safe. Our key takeaways from the newly published guidance are:
¬†
- Always check in with researchers before and after qualitative
fieldwork (especially when in-person!)
¬†
- Make space for concerns to be raised and addressed before
fieldwork begins
¬†
- Create a checklist for preparing for all qualitative fieldwork
¬†
- Personal characteristics of researchers e.g., gender, ethnicity,
sexuality can affect their experience conducting research. Check if people are comfortable working on projects and allow them to express their feelings of
discomfort.
¬†
As our work at Progressive spans a wide range of fields, from going into prisons to exploring personal health needs with seldom heard groups, this guidance will be an invaluable reference point for us when undertaking qual research in future.

Do this for each section of your topic guide. This will help you stay on track, meaning you won‚Äôt need to rush the backend of the guide (which can often be the most critical!)
¬†
Do: make sure you have a way of telling the time, such as a phone or watch. You need it to stay on track, but it‚Äôs particularly important if you are moderating groups online and sharing content for the discussion because you may not be able to see the time whilst sharing your screen.
¬†
Do: log on to the call early. This will give you enough time to make sure that the call is recording properly, you are able to share stimulus, and test anything that requires more technical setup (such as sharing your computer‚Äôs audio for any TV and radio adverts). It also gives you time to settle and practice your opening lines!
¬†
Don‚Äôt: try to take detailed notes and moderate at the same time. If you‚Äôre recording the group, focus on being attentive to what is being said and probe accordingly ‚Äì you can always listen back to the recording to clarify your understanding of certain points and pick out quotes. If you‚Äôre not recording the interview, it could be worth seeing if a colleague would be free to help you out with notetaking!
¬†
Don‚Äôt: spend too much time on introductions and warm up. It can be easy to get carried away with ‚Äòwhere do you live?‚Äô and ‚Äòwhat do you do for a living?‚Äô type questions, but it‚Äôs good to get into the main discussion as soon as possible. If you feel your group participants are spending too long on their introductions, reiterate that you‚Äôre just after a brief one/two-line intro.

Through research, testing and operational solutions, the consortium aims to provide industry-wide CCUS infrastructure to support the energy and chemicals sector by capturing CO2 emissions to utilize for making useful products like plastics and cement, or by transporting the CO2 to geological reservoirs in the Asia Pacific region for permanent and secure storage.
 
We believe that the future of energy is lower carbon.  This strategic alliance with like-minded collaborators will help us progress and advance the development of large-scale CCUS solutions in the Asia Pacific region for decades to come.

In celebration of Women‚Äôs History Month, we would like to spotlight, Ursula Lee, Co-Chair of AZ WIN, AutoZone's Women‚Äôs Business Resource Group. Ursula is a seven-year AutoZoner who has grown her career in Commercial credit from Administrator to her current position as Manager.  Ursula believes it is important to bring all the elements of who you are to work and employs this philosophy in leading her team and in participating in philanthropy. She also believes this is critical to networking within an inclusive and diverse workplace and to facilitating her own personal and professional development. 
 
AutoZone places an immense focus on supporting AutoZoners and the Greater Memphis community which closely aligns with her personal mission of being a helper of people.  Ursula is a Board member of the AutoZoner Assistance Fund (AAF), a nonprofit organization established to support fellow AutoZoners who experience short-term emergency funding needs resulting from natural disasters and personal tragedies. Ursula states, she is proudest when she sees AutoZoners whom she has helped develop, grow into successful and supportive leaders who, in turn, help to develop more up-and-coming leaders. ‚ÄúAutoZone‚Äôs Values and focus on impacting the community also enable me to connect with my community on a larger scale, helping to create healthier families, neighborhoods, and societies. This is my definition of true success.‚Äù   
  
In her free time, Ursula loves playing laser tag with her nieces and nephews and is the current reigning champ!

The Future Women in Kiewit Summit / Women‚Äôs Construction & Engineering Leadership Seminar was first held in 2010. Since then, nearly 900 U.S. and Canadian collegiate women majoring in construction and engineering have attended the event to network with Kiewit employees and gather personal perspectives about construction and engineering industry careers. The 2022 summit is next month and will feature a diverse group of Kiewit leaders. 

Our partnership with the Thurgood Marshall College Fund (TMCF) was established in 2022. In February, 20 Historically Black College & University (HBCU) students attended a two-day immersion event at Kiewit University in Omaha, Nebraska. During the event, students engaged with Kiewit employees from across the organization, who shared insights about their career journeys at Kiewit. Eight attendees interned with us this past summer and are receiving scholarship support for the 2022-2023 school year.

Our Women in Kiewit and Legacy Minority Scholarships, launched in 2018 and 2019, respectively, have supported the collegiate careers of 33 students. Recipients, who are dependents of Kiewit employees and majoring in construction or engineering fields, receive $5,000 per semester for four years, as well as internship opportunities with Kiewit.

""Work that Works gives me an unmatched level of flexibility; I have the freedom to plan my day and I feel a great sense of ownership and autonomy. I prioritize my office days for when in-person collaboration is essential, or on days where I don‚Äôt have back to back meetings, so I can engage and socialize with colleagues at the office. Working from home allows me to do more deep work undistracted and I have more time available to do things that normally would have been postponed to after office hours. Being at the office energizes me and helps me being more creative. To me the magic happens at the coffee machine, during lunch and at that impromptu brainstorming session where you‚Äôre leaning over a colleague‚Äôs desk to pick their brain on a problem you‚Äôve been stuck with for days. Being able to choose the setting that makes me most productive is something I highly value and appreciate and I can‚Äôt imagine working in a different way.""

Now, I work with so many people from different cultures. It is so awesome to share our differences, and all come together working for a company we love.

Three years ago, I started my career at Starbucks as a part time barista. I was only looking for something small to get out of the house while my kids were at school; in turn I quickly fell in love with the company and became a shift supervisor a year later. When I heard about the Starbucks College Achievement Plan (SCAP), which would allow me to get my first-time bachelor‚Äôs degree online with 100% upfront tuition coverage, I knew this was my chance to try. This fall I am beginning my fourth semester online at Arizona State University.

Today, SCAP is making my dream of earning a college degree come true. I never imagined I would get the opportunity like this, especially later in life. My kids get to see me accomplishing work goals as well as personal life goals I‚Äôve always had. They are now some of my biggest supporters and cheerleaders.

SCAP is expanding on career goals I previously didn‚Äôt think was even a possibility, and my degree will help me advance my career in leadership so that one day soon I can lead my own store.¬†

I cannot wait to see what the future holds and where my story takes me.""

I want the full in person college experience.‚Äô¬†
¬†
At the time I was a new high school graduate, anxious about starting a new job, scared to begin my college journey at my local community college, lost from the recent death of a parent, and confused with all the choice and opportunities ahead of me.
¬†
Over the years, many aspects of my life have changed. My father has been my absolute greatest, most supporting, patient and impactful person in my SCAP journey. He never went to college and knew he couldn‚Äôt always help me in the way that I needed. Yet, he was the only person who would stay up sitting at the kitchen table in silence while I try to write a paper, sobbing because I felt so defeated.
¬†
My father impacted by SCAP journey by unconditionally supporting me and reassuring me that failure oftentimes leads to new beginnings, hard times never last forever and it doesn‚Äôt matter how long it takes you to finish the race ‚Äì as long as you finish and believe that you‚Äôve already won.
¬†
[Today, 5 years later since starting at Starbucks] I realized my SCAP journey isn‚Äôt just saying I have a piece of paper to prove I‚Äôm educated, intelligent and worthy. Rather, my journey, jobs, relationships, and hardships are leaving a lasting impact on myself and the world around me. I am in fact an educated, intelligent and worthy‚Äîsometimes it just takes a push into the unknown to figure that out.‚Äù

As a 17-year partner (employee), Zabrina sometimes wonders if she would still be practicing law had she not decided to leave her firm for Starbucks. Her move was largely influenced by mentors helping guide her along the way.

‚ÄúLaw is a male dominated profession. I was attracted to Starbucks because the general counsel back then was an African American woman ‚Äì one of three or four at a Fortune 500 company at that time,"" she said. ""Having someone who looked like me, who was a leader, who could understand and relate to the issues that I had faced and encountered, was inspiring and helped me grow as a professional and taught me a lot about being a business leader at a company.‚Äù

For Zabrina, the responsibility to mentor others was something she learned growing up. Today, some of her mentorship is given through her executive sponsorship of the Black Partner Network at Starbucks, which brings many Black partners together to connect, serve communities and support one another.

‚ÄúAt Starbucks, [our] company values align with my own‚ÄîI‚Äôve always said, if there comes a day where the company‚Äôs values and mine are not aligned, it‚Äôs time for me to leave. It‚Äôs a place where I can continue to grow and have a number of opportunities and still feel like my personal value system is honored.‚Äù

¬†
As a first generation Nigerian American whose parents immigrated before he was born, Andrew faced challenges throughout his life where he was reminded of who he was, and who he wasn‚Äôt.
¬†
Visiting Nigeria for the first time at 9 years old, Andrew was humbled and inspired seeing where his parents came from. But during their time there, Andrew‚Äôs 12 year old brother developed malaria and after returning home to America, he passed away. Andrew watched how his parents remained dedicated to their faith, gaining strength and support during the difficult time.
¬†
‚Äú[It inspired] a strong belief in something bigger than myself. I would say that's the most tangible and pivotal thing that led from there. But also, I think [it put] just a hunger in me‚Äîbeing the only boy in the family, realizing I'm carrying on a legacy.‚Äù
¬†
Since then, Andrew has been dedicated to studying business, leadership and equity in the workplace and leading Starbucks licensed stores in the Indianapolis area. His passion for people and work culture has inspired his career as well as his authored book: The Circle of Leadership. For Andrew, being a good leader is about showing people empathy.
¬†
‚Äú[I want to have] awareness of who I'm talking to, what their struggles are, their backgrounds, I think that's important. Finding moments to create a safe space to open up and have some of those conversations and asking, ‚Äòhow are you really doing?‚Äô‚Äù
¬†
To Andrew, this behavior matches Starbucks Mission and Values. ‚ÄúThey're not just words that go on a wall or in a handbook. They're really trying to inspire and nurture the human spirit and take care of their partners.‚Äù

In honor of Barby and her husband, Belk made a $2,500 donation to the Alzheimer‚Äôs Foundation. But instead of simply making a donation on their behalf, our Snellville, GA associates invited Barby to her local store for a personal styling session.

On April 21st, members of GROW are scheduled to help spread mulch and help maintain previously planted trees at a local middle school. Each person can typically mulch 10 trees in the matter of a few hours, and the group‚Äôs goal is to be able to take care of up to 200 trees that day.

It turns out that Barby is a caregiver for her husband who suffers from Alzheimer's disease, and once we learned that we knew we definitely wanted to do more for her.
 
In honor of Barby and her husband, Belk made a $2,500 donation to the Alzheimer‚Äôs Foundation. But instead of simply making a donation on their behalf, our Snellville, GA associates invited Barby to her local store for a personal styling session. We gave Kenzie a $250 Belk gift card to use as she shopped with Barby, and then our store team surprised them with an additional $500.

Today, they hosted a virtual lunch and learn with TreesCharlotte, an organization that also received a $10,000 donation from Belk.

TreesCharlotte was established in 2012 to grow and diversify Charlotte, NC‚Äôs urban forest by promoting tree stewardship, growing Charlotte‚Äôs tree canopy, and educating others on how to plant and preserve trees. 

Since their first planting season in 2012, they have planted and/or distributed 43,346 trees throughout the Charlotte area! They have accomplished this through tree giveaway events and plantings in neighborhoods, schools, churches, parks and more.

On April 21st, members of GROW are scheduled to help spread mulch and help maintain previously planted trees at a local middle school. Each person can typically mulch 10 trees in the matter of a few hours, and the group‚Äôs goal is to be able to take care of up to 200 trees that day.

Synovus and other financial institutions have been made aware of a social media scam requesting financial assistance in the form of gift cards. After the gift cards are sent, the individual states the gift cards do not work and will give the customer instructions that lead to the customer calling fraudulent phone numbers. The final goal is for the customer to scan a QR code at a Bitcoin ATM at which point their account is drained. Stay Alert!

DO make sure it‚Äôs legit. Scammers see an opportunity to take advantage of your generosity so it‚Äôs important to do your homework before making a contribution.

DO trust your gut. Social engineering scams try to cash in on personal hardships and use scare tactics and a sense of urgency to get you to act quickly. 

DO look for reliable alternatives to make donations. It‚Äôs a good idea to search organization names on a charity watchdog site, like GuideStar and Charity Navigator.

DO protect your payments. The Federal Trade Commission recommends avoiding cash, gift cards, and money wires as payments, suggesting you stick to credit cards or checks instead.

Oscilloscope history begins in the 19th century when French Physicist Andre Blondel captured the first recorded waveforms on a galvanometer which detected changes in the current that was recorded by manually drawing a diagram of the wave formations.

William Duddell created the photographic oscillograph which used a mirror galvanometer that allowed waveforms to be measured and recorded directly.

In 1897 the cathode-ray tube, invented by Karl Ferdinand Braun, made it possible to record higher frequency measurements and led to the design of the first analog oscilloscope.

In 1946 Howard Vollum and Melvin Murdock developed the first triggered oscilloscope ‚Äî the Tektronix Model 511. It allowed for more precise measurements as the waveforms were displayed and then repeated to create a stronger graphed image.

Since then, oscilloscope development has grown exponentially. After 76 years, Tektronix is still the lead producer of oscilloscopes. Without innovators like Blondel, Duddell, Braun, Vollum, and Murdock, Tektronix would not be here today. Happy Inventors Day!

Through research, testing and operational solutions, the consortium aims to provide industry-wide CCUS infrastructure to support the energy and chemicals sector by capturing CO2 emissions to utilize for making useful products like plastics and cement, or by transporting the CO2 to geological reservoirs in the Asia Pacific region for permanent and secure storage.
 
We believe that the future of energy is lower carbon.  This strategic alliance with like-minded collaborators will help us progress and advance the development of large-scale CCUS solutions in the Asia Pacific region for decades to come.
